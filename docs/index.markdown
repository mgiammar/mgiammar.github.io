Hi, I'm Matthew Giammar a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley researching signal processing techniques in biological cryo-EM to identify proteins and other macromolecules in their native contexts.
My work spans algorithms & methods development, high-performance computing, and building open-source software for modern computational science.
<!-- See /projects and /publications for a list of current and prior project -->

I have previously worked on cheminformatics projects including diffusion-based small molecule generation and exploring mega-scale metabolic networks using HPC.
My undergraduate researched focused on developing [mrsimulator](https://github.com/deepanshs/mrsimulator), a cross-platform Python package for solid-state NMR spectrum simulation and analysis.
